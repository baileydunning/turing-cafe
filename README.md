# Turing Cafe

## Abstract

This mock reservations application was created under a 3 hour time limit for a M3 project at the Turing School of Software and Design. The original project spec can be seen [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/turing-cafe-ui). The app connects to an API ([repo link](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/turing-cafe-api)) that displays a list of reservations. The user is able to post a new reservation to the API by filling out the form and can delete one by pressing the "Cancel" button on the corresponding card.
